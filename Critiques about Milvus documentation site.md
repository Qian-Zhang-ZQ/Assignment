# Critiques about Milvus documentation site

### Summary

The entire documentation site takes the layout of a left menu bar with a content section on the right. It introduces an open source vector similarity search engine -- Milvus. The documentation includes installation guideline, user scenarios methods, essential features and further related concepts.

### Strengths

1. In general,the documentation is very informative. The product introduction is very detailed and specific. Users can find almost all necessary informations about Milvus easily.

   

2. The user guide is very user-friendly to beginners. Beginners can get started in a short time.

   

3. The FAQ section is well organized. It provides solutions to most common problems that users might encounter during their usage. People can check the problems and find the answers easily.



### Problems

1. For content part on the right side, the topics of some pages are not clear enough and the focus are not prominent as well. It contains too much plain text and the keypoints are hard to be remarked by the reader. For example, it was difficult for me to catch the point for the key feature when I was reading the Milvus Overview part. 

   


2. Too much use of declarative text, lack of chart support. For example, About Milvus --> Other Feature Vector Search Tools part, it has no specific comparison but a simple statement. It is difficult for users to realize the advantages of our product.

   

3. The design of the mini menu in the upper right corner of the page does not make full sense to me.  On the one hand, it is too hard for users to find this menu, on the other hand, when users slide to the bottom of the site, the mini menu disappeared.

   

4. The explanation of some concepts is a little bit redundant. For example, Guides --> Choosing a Distance Metric. Some users are probably not so concerned about this kind of mathematical details.

   

5. For the Milvus Benchmark section,  a summary to the charts is missing. This makes it harder for users to intuitively understand what those charts want to express.

   

### Suggestions

1. For the first and third problem, we can adjust the logical structures of the corresponding pages.  For the detailed introduction of some concepts, we can add check-box, users can read more about the concepts by clicking on this check-box. These informations are hidden by default. Hence, we can also use this check-box to replace the the mini-menu function .

   

2. For problem 2, it will be easier for users to  see the advantages of Milvus if we use a diagram to compare and summarize. Using different colors to emphasize makes certain contents or keywords more clear.

   

3. For problem 4, I would prefer to move those mathematical details to the reference part.

   

4. For problem 5, using some summary paragraphs to highlight our strengths may be better.
